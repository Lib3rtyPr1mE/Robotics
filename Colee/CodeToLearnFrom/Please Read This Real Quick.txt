Hey Nerds, I want you to use the 3 classes in this folder as a reference for how you should be programming.

I want this year to be used as a learning experience because it really can't be anything else.
These 3 classes have been hyper commented so please read the comments if something doesn't make sense.

You need to be able to problem solve and figure out solutions on your own because our code is only going to get you so far
and you should always be trying to make it better. I will not be giving out my github password as it is still my personal github however
I encourage you guys to make a github and to try to actually figure out how to program.

If you have any questions don't text me, text PaulüòÅ
